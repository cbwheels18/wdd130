            <p>Utah is a wonderful calm state to live in generally. 
                There are lots of things to do in all seasons. Lots 
                of lakes here make it ideal for boating and other 
                similar water sports. Wonderful outdoor places to 
                hike to and mountains to hike up. During the winter
                there are plenty of mountains to snowboard or ski 
                down as well.
